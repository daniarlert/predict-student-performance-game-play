This repository contains the notebooks used to generate the results for the Kaggle competition [Predict Student Performance from Game Play](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-student-performance-from-game-play). The highest score achieved was 0.682 using a XGBoost model. At the moment of writing the competition is still open so the overall position is not known yet.

> Since the dataset for this competition is very large, the notebooks would need to be run on Kaggle. The notebooks are then not intended to be run locally even though it is possible if you have access to the dataset.
